Here are the five gems:

ActiveModel: It seems this gem allows any class to be used with ActiveRecord.

ActiveRecord: Allows rails to talk with SQL using Object Relational Mapping. it 
uses a ruby object to map to a DB table. columns are accessed by methods. It also
provides CRUD. It uses a DSL for making SQL queries.

ActiveSupport: Provides Ruby clean syntax to all classes.

ActionPack: controls the controller and the view. However I do not understand how.

ActionMailer: allows you to email from your app.
